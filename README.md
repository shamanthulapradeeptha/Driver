DRIVER DROWSINESS DETECTION

1. What is Driver Drowsiness Detection?
Driver Drowsiness Detection is an intelligent safety system that continuously monitors a driver’s eye behavior, facial expressions, and head movements using a camera and AI algorithms.
When signs of sleepiness are detected, the system alerts the driver in real time to prevent accidents.
2. Motive of the Project
The main motive is to reduce road accidents caused by driver fatigue.
Why it is needed:
Drowsy driving causes thousands of accidents every year
Long-distance drivers (trucks, buses, taxis) are at high risk
Existing solutions are expensive and not accessible to everyone
👉 Goal: Build a low-cost, real-time, intelligent system that can be used by any driver.
3. Purpose of the Project 
The purpose is to:
Detect early signs of sleepiness
Warn the driver before an accident happens
Improve road safety using AI and computer vision
In simple words:
“The system acts like a virtual co-driver who never sleeps.”
4. How the System Works 
Camera captures live video of the driver
Face is detected using AI
Eye and facial features are analyzed
Drowsiness is calculated using parameters like:
Eye closure duration
Blink frequency
Yawning detection
If drowsiness exceeds threshold:
Alarm / voice alert is triggered
5. What is Implemented in the Project?
Hardware (optional depending on level):
Webcam or mobile camera
Raspberry Pi / Laptop
Software:
Python
OpenCV
Dlib / MediaPipe
Machine Learning model
Alarm module
Core Features Implemented:
✔ Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) calculation
✔ Blink rate monitoring
✔ Yawn detection
✔ Real-time alert system
✔ Continuous monitoring
